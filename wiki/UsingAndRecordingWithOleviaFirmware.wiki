#summary How to use the Olevia Firmware in New Zealand
#labels Featured,recording

= Introduction =

By now you should have installed the Olevia firmware on your Zinwell set-top box.

Most of the functionality is pretty obvious, and the same as the Zinwell firmware. There are some pointers that will help you with recording, scheduling and general usage of the box.

= Setting up a hard-drive =

Nowadays external USB hard-drives are pretty cheap and easy to come across. If you're lucky you'll have one already at home to test.

== USB or mains powered? ==
According to Olevia, we should use an externally powered drive. These have a power plug in addition to the USB cord.

I have used both USB and mains powered drives, and had no real problem with the USB-only powered device. In fact, this seems to warm up quicker and be more responsive.

It has been discussed somewhere on this post: [http://www.nzdtv.com/forum/showthread.php?t=304 NZ DTV Forum]

== Formatting the hard-drive ==
The Olevia firmware can read both FAT-32 and ext3 file systems.

 * _[FAT-32]_ is Windows' old system (before it switched to NTFS). It can still be read by Windows.
 * _[Ext3]_ is a Linux file system. It can't be natively read by Windows, but will be read by pretty much any modern Linux machine.

When you buy the hard-drive, often they'll be formatted in FAT-32 (but will often contain marketing material, which you will have to delete). If you get the Olevia firmware to format the hard-drive it will use ext3.

It can be very difficult to format a large USB HDD in FAT-32, as Windows has removed this ability. Third-party software (e.g. Partition Magic) may be able to do this.

= Recording =

== Casual recording ==
To record what is on at the moment, press the *Picture* button on the [RemoteControl remote control] (2nd along in the bottom row of buttons).

This will start recording the current programme on the current channel. A small recording display will feature briefly. The recording is titled as loaded from the EIT data on the [ElectronicProgrammeGuide EPG]. If we were continue to record the next show, it is still kept under this name.

To stop recording, press the *Picture* button again. If you do not press this button, it will continue to record until you are out of disk space. Unfortunately there is no way set a timer on this recording, to do this we need to use the scheduler.

== Changing channels while recording ==
While recording you are able to watch other channels on the same mux. This means, for instance, that you can record TV3 and watch C4, or record TV1 and watch TV2 at the same time.

But you cannot record TV3 and watch TV1 as they are on different muxes. You can flick through these channels, but the message below is shown instead of the correct picture.

== Scheduling a recording =
There are two ways to schedule a recording:
 * From the [ElectronicProgrammeGuide Electronic Programme Guide]
 * Adding a time manually through the menu

The EPG method will only work with the EIT EPG. This is what loads if the MHEG guide is not immediately ready to load. Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, Freeview detrimentally only transmits the next four TV shows via EIT.

To get into the EIT version, change to another channel, change back then press the EPG button. This increases the chance that the MHEG list won't have loaded.

Once you've got the EIT EPG, select the programme to record. Then press the *Picture* button on the remote. It will bring up a window with the appropriate times. You may want to adjust these slightly to give some margin of error, or to record the next show.

= Editing =
There are no built-in features to skip through ads, split a recording into two, or to fix programmes recorded under an incorrect name.

If you can access your HDD from Windows (e.g. you have ext3 support or disk format is FAT-32), my software [http://code.google.com/p/zorve/ Zorve] allows you to change the title and description of the recorded files.

== Ext3 in Windows ==
There is software that provides ext3 support at http://www.fs-driver.org/
