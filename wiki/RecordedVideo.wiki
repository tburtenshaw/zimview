#summary What the Olevia firmware records onto the hard disk.

= Disk format and partitioning =

The hard drive you use with your new firmware can be either in _FAT32_ or _ext3_ format. If you get the firmware to format it for you, it chooses ext3.

[Ext3] has the advantage of being able to handle larger drive sizes and larger files. It also more natively handles filenames beginning with a period.

The advantage with [FAT32] is that you can Windows it to access the disk without any other software.

In terms of partitioning, I have seen [Olevia] just stick to the first partition on a disk formatted into two FAT32 partitions.

In a drive that Olevia formatted , it divided the drive into two partitions and uses both of these to write to. I am not sure how the decision is made on which one to record to.

== File and directory structure ==

Olevia will leave whatever else is on your disk in place. (Unless of course you format it.)

It creates a folder called _!Record_Video_ in the root directory.

All the video files are contained in this directory.

Here is an example:

You can see in the above example that there are five video (.mpg) files. You will also notice that two other file types with each _mpg_.

===File names===
Each time part of a TV show is recorded, a triplet of files are made.

The _mpg_ and the _nav_ files are both preceded by a period. In [Linux] systems this means the file would ordinarily be hidden from view.

The file is named by the start of the recording time:
 * Four digits for the year
 * Then a capital _Z_
 * Two digit month
 * Two digit date
 * Underscore
 * Four digit time (24 hour clock).
 * Underscore
 * Then an incremental number to differentiate recordings at the same minute.

The channel or frequency that was recorded is *not* part of the file name.

===File types===
The _mpg_ file is a [MpegTransportStream MPEG Transport Stream]. These are not always easy to get working.

The extension-less file contains information about the recording. It is always 4096 bytes in size. See [InformationFile4096 some more about this file here].

The _nav_ file is a [MpegNavigationFile navigation file] that likely contains pointers (can be looked at as "co-ordinates") in the mpeg to help speed nagivation when skipping.
