#summary Describes .zim blocks and their different types.
#labels firmware

= Introduction =

Each .zim file contains a number of blocks. These blocks store information that is used by the SetTopBox during an upgrade.

The blocks that have been seen in the wild are:
 * BOXI blocks
 * VERI blocks
 * CODE blocks
 * KERN blocks
 * ROOT blocks
 * NVRM blocks
 * LOAD blocks
 * MACA blocks

Two that may also exist (their strings are visible in the firmware's executable file [zmw_base_zinwell]. They are UVER and MCUP.

= General structure =

Each block has the same type of header.

This is from the source code:
{{{
  char  name[4]; // 'ROOT', 'CODE', 'VERI', 'BOXI', 'KERN', 'LOAD','NVRM'
  DWORD dwDataLength;
  DWORD reserved[2]; // zero-filled
  CHAR  blockSignature[4]; // 'B','S', 0x00, 0x00
  DWORD dwChecksum; // Broken Adler-32
}}}

The data starts immediately after the header.

== BOXI (box information) blocks ==

The BOXI blocks have information about the [SetTopBox set-top box] including version numbers.

The "Box Info" line on the New Zealand [Freeview] box shows an example of what this contains.

http://zimview.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/freeview_system_info_1.0.8.jpg

Each BOXI block is 36 bytes (plus the block header).

This is the structure of a BOXI block:
{{{
  WORD  uiOUI; //Organizationally Unique Identifier
  WORD  reserved[3]; // 0x00 filled
  WORD  wHwVersion; //unsure if this order is correct
  WORD  wSwVersion;
  WORD  wHwModel;
  WORD  wSwModel;
  char  abStarterMD5Digest[16];
  DWORD uiStarterImageSize;
}}}

== KERN (kernel) blocks ==

KERN blocks contain a gzipped _vmlinux_ executable. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vmlinux Vmlinux] is an executable file that contains the linux kernel. In the Olevia and "Sony" versions this is an ELF executable.

http://zimview.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/kern_block_open.png

The file (i.e. vmlinux) is never unzipped. It is copied onto the [FlashMemory flash memory] of the set-top box directly. Specifically it goes to _flash0.kernel_.

== NVRM (non-volatile ram) blocks ==

NVRM blocks aren't in the [Olevia] zim files. This suggests that this part of the firmware is not updated very often.

This block contains mostly padding with 0xFF, a few random binary characters, then what looks like a start up variable.

{{{STARTUP=boot -z -elf flash0.kernel: 'root=/dev/mtdblock0 rootfstype=squashfs'}}}

You can see this string in action in the boot string (this example from [Freeview] box)
{{{
Loader:elf Filesys:raw Dev:flash0.kernel File: Options:root=/dev/mtdblock0 rootfstype=squashfs
Loading: 0x80197086/69530 Entry address is 0x8017f000
}}}

== VERI (verification or version info) blocks ==
VERI blocks contain a number of listings that correspond to the blocks before it. The information about the blocks includes: _(taken from dtvforum.co.nz)_
{{{
  char  blockName[4];
  char  version_d;
  char  version_c;
  char  version_b;
  char  version_a; // version = a.b.d
  DWORD reserved[2]; // 0xFF filled
  BYTE  md5Digest[16]; // Calculated on the relevant Block.data
}}}

So it has the name of the block. Then the version number of that block.

== MACA (MAC address) blocks ==

This block was first seen in version 2.1.1 of Olevia's 620 firmware, where internet connectivity was added to allow use of a [HongKong Hong Kong] based video-on-demand service.

It contains a large number of Media Access Control addresses (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address MAC address on Wikipedia]).

It is basically an ASCII text file with 2000 lines (each with Windows style CR-LFs ending the line). Each MAC consists of 6 two-digit hexadecimal numbers, separated by hyphens.

This is an example of the first eight out of 2000 MAC addresses in the ZMT620 (Ver 2.1.1) zim file.
{{{
00-05-9e-90-0b-93
00-05-9e-90-0b-94
00-05-9e-90-0b-95
00-05-9e-90-0b-96
00-05-9e-90-0b-97
00-05-9e-90-0b-98
00-05-9e-90-0b-99
00-05-9e-90-0b-9a
}}}

By using a [http://www.8086.net/tools/mac/ lookup tool] we can see that the range from  00-05-9E block is owned by the [Zinwell] Corporation. The mailing address to this firm is _7F, No.512, Yuan-Shan Road, TAIWAN, REPUBLIC OF CHINA_.
