#summary About New Zealand and its digital TV set-up
#labels misc

= Introduction =

New Zealand is a country in the Southern Pacific. Despite some cultural self-loathing comments, we are a first world country. We have good healthcare and education, and even some good movies and homemade TV shows.

Our small size means we tend to use technology that other countries used, otherwise no-one would make hardware for us.

= Broadcast television in NZ =

New Zealand has analogue free-to-air television broadcast, which most in the country can receive. Our free-to-air digital network is called [Freeview], which has both satellite and terrestrial broadcast. The main competing network is [SkyTV Sky Television], which has a digital satellite television service (having only recently switched off its analogue service).

Freeview's satellite TV is only in standard-definition (and at a lower bitrate than many would like). Sky transmits some HD over satellite. The big three channels (TV1, TV2 & TV3) on terrestrial Freeview transmit in 1080i or 720p.
