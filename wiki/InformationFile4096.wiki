#summary Contains the information I have worked out about the 4096 byte information files.

= Introduction =

Whenever you record with your [Olevia] firmware, it creates an information file about the recording. (More information about where these files are is at RecordedVideo).

This information file is used be the recorder when you browse what you have recorded.

== Example contents ==
This picture contains two open information files.

= Details =

I am drafting up a possible layout for the files.

{{{

struct infoFile {
    unsigned long  magic;
    unsigned short number1;

    char title[120]; //the title seems to be 120 bytes
    char description[511];
}

}}}
