#summary Contains the information I have worked out about the 4096 byte information files.

= Introduction =

Whenever you record with your [Olevia] firmware, it creates an information file about the recording. (More information about where these files are is at RecordedVideo).

This information file is used be the recorder when you browse what you have recorded.

== Example contents ==
This picture contains two open information files.

= Details =
To me, it appears this file contains a lot of 'junk'. That is much of the file is untouched and just whatever already happens to be on that part of the hard disk.


== Offsets ==
 * 0x0006 (6)    Title
 * 0x007e (126)  Description
 * 0x0284 (644)  ce:da:53:42 (comes out as IUSB) //this may be the date
 * 0x028a (650)  Hour of recording as byte (0-23)
 * 0x028b (651)  Minute of recording as byte (0-59)

 * 0x0a84 (2692)  ce:da:53:42 (comes out as IUSB) //this may be the date
 * 0x0a8a (2698)  Hour of recording as byte (0-23)
 * 0x0a8b (2699)  Minute of recording as byte (0-59)

 * 0x0c04 (3076) Location of the MPEG file
 * 0x0d04 (3332) Location of the navigation file
 * 0x0e60 (3680) Jpeg image location

== Structure ==
I am drafting up a possible layout for the files.

{{{

struct infoFile {
    unsigned long  magic;
    unsigned short number1;

    char title[120]; //the title seems to be 120 bytes
    char description[511];
}

}}}
