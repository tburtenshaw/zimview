#summary The MPEG-TS and Freeview
#labels recording

= Introduction =

*MPEG Transport Streams* are a list of data with no particular start or finish. They consist of a number of packets, and these packets contain the video, audio and other data.

To save on processing power, when the set-top box records a TV show it basically records the data it needs as is. It does not reprocess the video, it just ignores any packets on other TV channels.

This means recorded video is exactly the same to watch one being broadcast.

= Details =

Each packet of the recorded video file is 188 bytes in size.

Each packet has a _packet identifier_ (or PID). This helps to separate separate streams.

= Playing the MPEG-TS =
Depending on what codecs you have installed on your computer, you might be able to play the ts files on a number of different media players (e.g Media Player Classic, Windows Media Player, VLC). There is a lot of problems playing sound though.

!VideoRedo allows you to play the files you recorded on your Zinwell. You can also cut ads, crop out blackspace, and convert to other file formats (e.g. DVD, DivX).
