# Introduction #

**Dick Smith Electronics** (**DSE**) is a [New Zealand](NewZealand.md) and [Australian](Australia.md) electronics retailer.

The familiar nerdy face of Dick Smith was removed from branding towards the end of 2009. At the same time instated the awkward slogan _Talk to the techsperts_.

They have products under their name which are rebranded. Their version of the Zinwell 620 HD is identical, except DSE sold it cheaper and included an [HDMI](HDMI.md) cable. (This is in comparison to somewhere like HarveyNorman who sell the Zinwell without a cable, then convince naive buyers that they need a MonsterCable for $200.)
