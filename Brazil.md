# Introduction #
Brazil is a large country in South America. They use the [ISDB-T](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDB) standard, which is different from DVB-T which New Zealand uses.

There are a couple of set-top box makers that use .zim files.

  * [Zinwell](Zinwell.md) makes the [ZBT-620]
  * [Philips](Philips.md) makes/markets the [DTR1007B](DTR1007B.md)

There is a Portuguese-speaking forum which has discussed modification of these machines: [HT Forum](http://www.htforum.com/vb/forumdisplay.php?f=129).
