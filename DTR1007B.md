# Introduction #

[Philips](Philips.md) in [Brazil](Brazil.md) makes a set-top box for Brazilian digital television.

Inside this box is just the [ZBT-620] (and the [ZMT-620]) as pointed out by someone on this [flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/7560942@N04/2466429906/).

The industrial designers at Philips seem to be a bit more skilled than the ones at [Zinwell](Zinwell.md). Here is the casing in stylish white:

Google [pbstb\_7402\_v053.zip](http://www.google.co.nz/search?q=pbstb_7402_v053.zip) to find an example of their firmware - don't install the firmware to a NZ machine though!
